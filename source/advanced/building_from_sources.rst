Building Renode from source
===========================

This document provides detailed information on how to prepare the build environment, and then build and test Renode itself.

Prerequisites
-------------

Core prerequisites
++++++++++++++++++

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      The following instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, however there should not be any major issues preventing you from using other (especially Debian-based) distributions as well.

      First, install the ``mono-complete`` package as per the installation instructions for various Linux distributions which can be found on `the Mono project website <https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin>`_.

      To install the remaining dependencies, use::

         sudo apt-get update
         sudo apt-get install git automake autoconf libtool g++ realpath policykit-1 \
                      libgtk2.0-dev screen uml-utilities gtk-sharp2 python2.7

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      On macOS, the Mono package can be obtained by using `a download link on the Mono project website <https://download.mono-project.com/archive/mdk-latest-stable.pkg>`_.

      To install the remaining prerequisites, use::

         brew install binutils gnu-sed coreutils homebrew/versions/gcc49 dialog

      .. note::

         This requires `homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_ to be installed in your system.

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      Building Renode on Windows is based on Cygwin and requires you to properly set up the system environment.

      .. rubric:: Cygwin
      
      1. Download `Cygwin installer <https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe>`_.
      2. Install it with an additional module: ``openssh``.
      3. You need to have ``git`` installed, either as a Cygwin package, or natively. If you use it as a native Windows application, you have to add the installation directory to the system ``PATH`` variable.

      .. note::

          Prior to cloning the repository on *Windows*, git has to be configured appropriately::

              git config --global core.autocrlf false
              git config --global core.symlinks true

      .. rubric:: Python 2.7

      1. Download and install **native** Windows Python framework from `the Python website <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.

      .. note::

         Do not use the module provided by ``Cygwin``. If you have Cygwin's version of Python already installed, make sure that the native's version location is included at the beginning of Cygwin's PATH variable.

      2. Add location of the binaries (``C:\Python27`` by default) to the system ``PATH`` variable.

      .. rubric:: C build tools

      1. Download the `MinGW-w64 installer <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/latest/download?source=files>`_.
      2. Install the latest version with the ``x86_64`` architecture and ``win32`` threads.
      3. Add the location of the binaries (it depends on the MinGW version and installation settings e.g. ``C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-win32-sjlj-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin``) to the system ``PATH`` variable.

      .. rubric:: C# build tools

      1. Download `VS Build Tools 2017 <https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=15#>`_.
      2. Run the installer, select the *Visual Studio Build Tools 2017* product and click *Install* or *Modify*.
      3. Switch to the *Individual components* pane and select:

         * *.NET Framework 4.5 targeting pack* in section *.NET*,
         * *NuGet targets and build tasks* in section *Code tools*.

      4. Add the location of the binaries (``C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\BuildTools\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\amd64`` by default) to the system ``PATH`` variable.

Additional prerequisites (for Robot framework testing)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you followed the instructions above, Python should be installed in your system.
Install the ``pip`` package manager and some additional modules to enable writing and running test cases with the Robot framework::

    python -m pip install robotframework netifaces requests psutil

Downloading the source code
---------------------------

Renodeâ€™s source code is available on GitHub::

   git clone https://github.com/renode/renode.git

Submodules will be automatically initialised and downloaded during the build process, so you do not need to do it at this point.

Building Renode
---------------

.. note::

    On Windows, the building process described in this section can only be executed in a Cygwin shell.

To build Renode, run::

   ./build.sh

There are some optional flags you can use::

   -c          clean instead of building
   -d          build in debug configuration
   -v          verbose mode
   -p          build binary packages (requires some additional dependencies)

You can also build ``Renode.sln`` from your IDE (like MonoDevelop or Visual Studio), but the ``build.sh`` script has to be run at least once.

Creating packages
-----------------

The build script can create native packages only, i.e., you must run it on Windows to create an ``.msi`` installer package, on Linux for ``.deb``, ``.rpm`` and ``.pkg.tar.xz`` packages or on macOS for the ``.dmg`` image.

Prerequisites
+++++++++++++

Depending on the system, there may be some prerequisites for building packages.

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Linux

        Run commands::

            sudo apt-get install ruby rpm bsdtar
            sudo gem install fpm

    .. group-tab:: Windows

        .. note::

            On Windows 10, it is important to enable .NET 3.5 in the system before installing WiX Toolset.

            The packaging process described in this section can only be executed in Cygwin shell.

        1. Download and install `The WiX Toolset installer <http://wixtoolset.org/releases/>`_ (version at least 3.11).
        2. Add the ``zip`` package to Cygwin.

Building
++++++++

To build binary packages, run::

    ./build.sh -p

The packages will have a version assigned to them, defined by the contents of ``tools/version`` file.

You can also build nightly packages with::

    ./build.sh -pn

This will append a date and a commit SHA to the output files.

Location of packages
++++++++++++++++++++

After completing successfully, the script will print the location of the files created::

    Linux:              renode/output/packages/renode_<version>.{deb|rpm|tar.gz}
    Windows:            renode/output/pakcages/renode_<version>.msi
    macOS:              renode/output/packages/renode_<version>.dmg
