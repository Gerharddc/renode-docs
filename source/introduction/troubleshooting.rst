Troubleshooting
===============

If you encounter a problem, please check if your problem has not been reported previously in `our GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/renode/renode/issues>`_.
Note that we also have our internal issue tracking system and we might already be aware of your problem, but just gotten around to fixing it.
Still, it's worthwhile to bring your use case to our attention so that we know there's someone affected by the bug.

The Renode team and external users may also be aware of some workarounds or alternative ways to accomplish what you want to do and suggest those.

To speed up the process of getting help, please:

a) reduce your example to the minimal example that still does not work for you
b) state your platform, Renode version used, and if possible, what you are trying to achieve (context helps!)
c) provide all the files needed to reproduce the problem 1:1 (``.repl``, ``.resc`` and software files), preferably with a precompiled binary
d) provide logs - the Renode log and UART terminal output where relevant.

Especially c) and d) help us confirm the bug and act on it.
