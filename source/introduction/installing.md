# Installing Renode

The installation process of the Renode framework depends on the operating system.
Please use the packages available on [Renode's Github](https://github.com/renode/renode/releases/latest).

The complete installation instructions are described in the [Renode project README](https://github.com/renode/renode/blob/master/README.md#installation).

You can also run Renode in a Docker container - see [the README](https://github.com/renode/renode/blob/master/README.md#running-renode-in-a-docker-container) for details how to do that.

For instructions how to install Renode from sources (for advanced users) see {doc}`../advanced/building_from_sources`.
