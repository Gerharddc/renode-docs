Installing Renode
=================

The installation process of the Renode framework depends on the operating system.
Please use the packages available on `Renode's Github <https://github.com/renode/renode/releases/latest>`_.

The complete installation instructions are described in the `Renode project README <https://github.com/renode/renode/blob/master/README.rst#installation>`_.

You can also run Renode in a Docker container - see `the README <https://github.com/renode/renode/blob/master/README.rst#running-renode-in-a-docker-container>`_ for details how to do that.

For instructions how to install Renode from sources (for advanced users) see :ref:`building-from-source`.
